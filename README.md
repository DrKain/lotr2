This is a monorepo. For a specific project setup/config, check those project subfolders.

It would be nice to have a cool docker setup that abstracts having to set up both projects.

## Getting Started

Run `npm install` to install all related dependencies.

## Running Both Projects

Run `npm start` and the client and server will both start up.
