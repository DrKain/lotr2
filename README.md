# Land of the Rair

This is a monorepo. For a specific project setup/config, check those project subfolders.

It would be nice to have a cool docker setup that abstracts having to set up both projects.

## Getting Started

* `npm install` - install dependencies for the client and server.
* `npm run setup` - setup both the client and server for development.

## Running Both Projects

Run `npm start` and the client and server will both start up.
